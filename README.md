## Overview

This project implements a simple load balancer using Flask in Python. The load balancer supports five common load balancing algorithms:
1. Round Robin
2. Weighted Round Robin
3. Least Connections
4. Least Response Time
5. IP Hash

Additionally, it includes health checks for the backend servers.

Use Docker to simulate 3 servers and distribute traffic to the servers.
